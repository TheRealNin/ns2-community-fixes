The fixes are so far as follows:
* BotBrain: Reduces glitchy bot movement
* Cheats: Disables some cheaty console commands and ones that break the server
* CommanderSensor: makes sensor blips visible to commanders

* Hallucinations: Make hallucinations "poof" instead of ragdoll
* Ladder: Makes climbing ladders faster and less glitchy
* Railgun: Allows shooting railguns into skyboxes
